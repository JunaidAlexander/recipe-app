What you'll need:
-penne pasta - or substitute with your favourite kind of pasta. I like the penne shape because it traps so much delicious sauce inside.

- cherry tomatoes
- Parmesan cheese
- salt and pepper

How to makethe penne pasta.
1.Bring a large pot of water to a boil over medium-high heat. Add penne pasta and a little bit salt, and cook till al dente (fully cooked but still firm) about 8-10 minutes, or according to package directions. Do not overcook the pasta. Turn off the heat and reserve at least ¼ cup of pasta water, then drain the pasta in a colander and let it cool for 1 minute.
2.Toss in pesto. Transfer pasta into a large mixing bowl and add pesto and reserved pasta water (¼ cup or more, if desired). Season with salt and pepper and toss well to coat. Stir in cherry tomatoes and parmesan cheese. 3. Serve. Serve immediately. Sprinkle extra parmesan on top, if desired.
